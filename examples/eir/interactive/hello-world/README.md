# Hello, World!

Demonstrates: **0 inputs → 1 output** pattern

## Description

A simple greeting program that outputs a fixed message with no input processing. This is the simplest possible I/O pattern—just a single output effect with no input effects.

## Input Pattern

- No input effects (no `readLine` or `readInt`)

## Output Pattern

- Single `print` effect outputting the message "Hello, World!"

## Running

```bash
pnpm run-example eir/interactive/hello-world
```

## Expected Output

```
Hello, World!
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the simplest output-only program structure
- See how `print` effect works with literal strings
- Compare against programs that also have input processing
